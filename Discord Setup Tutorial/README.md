# Discord Setup Tutorial Article

**NOTE:** This portfolio piece is still in development.

I started running tabletop roleplaying games shortly before the world locked down in 2020.
Fortunately, virtual tabletops and chat apps, like Roll20 and Discord, offered me *almost*
everything I needed to continue my hobby in stride. Support for music was the one thing I
couldn't find. I was also a bit intimidated by the idea of running my own gaming server.

I wrote this article for other online roleplayers. It displays my ability to present technical
concepts in simple terms and a casual tone to a non-technical audience. It also displays my
ability to create gifs and use callouts using Snagit.
