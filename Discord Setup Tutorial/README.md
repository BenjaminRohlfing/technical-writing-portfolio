**NOTE:** This portfolio piece is still in development.

This document describes how to create and initially configure a Disord server meant to be used to facilitate TTRPG games.

I started running tabletop roleplaying games shortly before the world retreated into lockdown in 2020. Fortunately, virtual tabletops and chat apps, like Roll20 and Discord, offered me *almost* everything I needed to continue my hobby in stride. Support for music was the one thing I couldn't find, though. I was also a bit intimidated by the idea of running my own gaming server. So, I wrote this article for other online roleplayers.

**Career skills** on display:

- my ability to present technical concepts in simple terms and a casual tone to a non-technical audience
- my ability to create gifs and use callouts
- my ability to use Snagit
