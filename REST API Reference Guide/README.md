**Note:** This document contains mock links to other documents. These links simply lead back to the API document.

Knights and Sorcerers (KAS) is a fictional massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG) that I imagined for this example of RESTful API documentation. It's meant to be similar to existing MMORPGs, like World of Warcraft.
