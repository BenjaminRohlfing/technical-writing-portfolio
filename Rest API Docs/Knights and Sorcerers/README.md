### Knights and Sorcerers

Knights and Sorcerers (KAS) is a fictional massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG) that I imagined for this example of RESTful API documentation. Imagine that KAS is similar to existing MMORPGs, like World of Warcraft.

**Note:** The API document contains mock links to other documents. These links lead back to the API document.
