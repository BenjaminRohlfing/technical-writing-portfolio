### Knights and Sorcerers API Reference Guide

Knights and Sorcerers (KAS) is a fictional massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG)
that I imagined for this example of RESTful API documentation. Imagine that KAS is similar to
existing MMORPGs, like World of Warcraft.

This reference guide displays my understanding of fundamental web concepts and my ability to create
and use code samples.

**Note:** The API document contains mock links to other documents. These links lead back to the
API document.
