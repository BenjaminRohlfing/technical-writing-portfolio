# Git and GitHub Training Deck

When I joined the High Performance Computing writers at Hewlett Packar Enterprise, our documents where hosted on Bitbucket.
Months later, we migrated to GitHub, which offers the same service but with a different user interface. I recognized this
as an opportunity to train my team on both Git and the new interface of GitHub.

These slide decks show the introduction to my training decks. They display my ability to create visually and narratively
engaging, professional-grade presentation material. I have included a presentation deck and a digital handout deck, which
would be emailed to attendees after the presentation.
