# Git and GitHub Training Decks

When I joined the High Performance Computing writers at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, our documents where hosted on Bitbucket. Months later, we migrated to GitHub, which offers essentially the same service but with a different interface. I recognized this as an opportunity to train my team on GitHub and also on Git, which some writers weren't comfortable using.

These slide decks show the introduction slides of my training decks. I've included a presentation deck and a digital handout deck, which I be emailed to attendees after the presentation.
