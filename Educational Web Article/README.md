# Educational Article: What is an API?

This work sample is live on the Fastly documentation site. It was published very shortly after I was laid off from my role there, but I was heavily involved in the drafting and editing stages of its development. It is meant to be a high level introduction to the concept of an API for readers with some basic technical knowledge.
