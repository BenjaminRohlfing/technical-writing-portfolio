# Benjamin Rohlfing's Technical Writing Portfolio

I'm a technology professional with extensive experience in software development and technical writing. I bring my skills in each field into the other. As a technical writer, I leverage my software skills to build and maintain Docs-as-Code tooling and pipelines. I am also uniquely positioned to provide first-line insight as a subject matter expert to my teams. As a software developer, I use my skills in communication and writing documentation to ensure excellent internal and external user experiences.

In my free time, I write and occasionally publish third-party content for Dungeons & Dragons.
