# Benjamin Rohlfing's Technical Writing Portfolio

I'm a technical writer with a background in software development and computer science.
As a student of computer science, and then as a developer, I spent years steeped in
technical communication. Because of this extensive experience, I have a keen understanding
of what makes software and hardware documents effective.

I'm currently enrolled in Metropolitan State University's Technical Writing program.

These writing samples were written as creative personal projects, professional deliverables,
academic assignments, and at the request of employers during interview processes.
