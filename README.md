# Benjamin Rohlfing's Technical Writing Portfolio

I'm a technology professional with extensive experience in software development and technical writing. In both fields, I've worked and delivered high quality results up and down the "stack". From back- and front-end software to highly technical developer-focused documentation and educational web content.

My skill set is truly cross-functional. I bring my skills in each field into the other. As a technical writer, I leverage my software skills to build and maintain Docs-as-Code tooling and pipelines. I am also uniquely able to provide first-line insight as a subject matter expert to my teams. As a software developer, I use my technical writer skills to facilitate high-caliber inter- and cross-team collaboration and write professional grade documentation for everything that I work on.

In my free time, I write and occasionally publish third-party content for Dungeons & Dragons!
