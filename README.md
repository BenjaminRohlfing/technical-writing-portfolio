# Benjamin Rohlfing's Technical Writing Portfolio


I'm a technology professional with extensive experience in software engineering and technical writing. In both fields, I've worked up and down the stack. As a writer, I've published everything form highly specialized system administrator documentation to introductory tech-focused web content. As a software engineer, I've designed and implemented relational and non-relational databases, APIs to SOAP and RESTful requirements; I've worked on monolithic enterprise applications and deployed serverless apps to cloud platforms, and I've implemented frontend UIs to brand specifications.

In my free time, I write and occasionally publish third-party content for Dungeons & Dragons!
