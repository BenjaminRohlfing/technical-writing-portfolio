# Benjamin Rohlfing's Technical Writing Portfolio

I'm a technical writer with a background in software development and computer science.
As a student of computer science, and then as a developer, I spent years steeped in
technical communication. Because of this extensive experience, I have a keen understanding
of what makes software and hardware documents effective.

I'm currently enrolled in Metropolitan State University's Technical Writing program.
