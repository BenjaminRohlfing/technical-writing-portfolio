# Benjamin Rohlfing's Technical Writing Portfolio

I'm a technical writer with 3.5 years of professional experience writing technical content and a background in software development and computer science. As a student of computer science, and then as a developer, I spent years steeped in technical communication. Because of this extensive user experience, I have a keen understanding of what makes software and hardware documents effective.

I'm currently enrolled in Metropolitan State University's Technical Writing program.
