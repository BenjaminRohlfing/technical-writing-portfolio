# D&D 5e Encounter

This document defines the essential narrative and mechanical elements of a Dungeons & Dragons encounter.
Its purpose is to give game masters a high-quality, low-investment scene to present to their players. It
displays my ability to design and write compact, scannable, and interesting reference material. It's also
an example of my ability to work with beta testers (play testers) and illustrators. I created it with
Adobe InDesign.

This was the first encounter document that I published. Since publication, it has sold a handful of copies.

**NOTES:**
- The document/encounter name, *Shadows Bite*, is not a grammatical error.
- The phrase "jutting perpendicular" is an intentional, artistic grammatical deviation.
